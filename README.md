# Sort
An assortment of sorting algorithms


## Inserstion Sort
- Performance:

  Worst Case: `O(n^2)`

  When partially sorted: `O(kn)` where k is the max displacement from the current position and desired position of any given data point.

- Space:

  `O(1)` given the algorithm is done in place.

- Special properties.
  1. In-place
  2. Online
  3. Stable

## Selection Sort
- Performance:

  Worst Case: `O(n^2)`

- Space:

  `O(1)` given the algorithm is done in place.

- Special properties.
  1. In-place
  2. Able to perform in n-1 swaps
  3. Worse than inserstion sort in most ways
